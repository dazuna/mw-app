    "help-answers7": "You will need to register to be able to apply for a position. Still it is free and you only need to share your information once to be able to apply to any position posted on MUUWHO. The better your MUUWHO profile is, the more the companies will be interested in you.",
    "help-answers8": "No, you need to create a MUUWHO account to gain access to the site and App. It is really easy though and free.",
    "help-answers9": "No, the chat is exclusively for messages between contacts.",
    "help-answers10": "Just look through the positions posted, when you find one you think one of your friends could be a good fit for, press “hitch”. If the person you are hitching is already a part of your MUUWHO-network select him/her from the list, if not just write his/her e-mail in the box that says “e-mail” and press send. That easy!",
    "help-answers11": "The strength of a recommendation is what MUUWHO is based on. You are therefore more than welcome to apply to a position, but you will have to request someone to hitch you. It’s really easy though, just write the e-mail of your friend in the box and press “send request”",
